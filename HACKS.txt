Three things where alterated for the taint analysis:

To get sources I introduced a function fakeTaintSource which just calls
getParameter. Declaring getParameter as a source doesn't work right away
but it is easy to fix in goto-analyser.

To get sink I introduced a function fakeTaintSink and replaced queryOne
by a function that calls fakeTaintSink on its arguments and then calls
query One. This is also something easy to fix.

There was a clash in names because the root function is declared two
times with different argument so I renamed the function that I wanted
as root to getPlayer4 instead of getPlayer. The original problem is
probably a bug in goto-analyzer and should be fixed.
